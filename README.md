## Greyscale Chrome Extension
###### Will Hodge

A simple Chrome extension that, when clicked, turns all Chrome tabs to black and white. Clicking the icon activates the extension which turns the currently open tabs to greyscale as well as any future tabs. Clicking the icon again deactivates the greyscale.

Greyscale pages are easier on the eyes and limit the addictive nature of webpages (see [here](http://www.tristanharris.com/2016/05/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Afrom-a-magician-and-googles-design-ethicist/)).
